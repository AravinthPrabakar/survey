1. control-plane
2. data-plane 
Currently it is part of same application but it can be separated to 
support high scalability. 
- control-plane is the micro-service which serves 
administration of the survey and questions like create survey, add/edit/delete/get questions 
and get distribution report for question. 
- data-plane is the micro-service 
which serves customer requests like listing all questions and submitting survey
response.

**Assumptions:**
1. Survey need to be created before question creation
2. All the questions are mandatory in the survey
